YARN stands for "Yet Another Resource Negotiator" and was added later as part of Hadoop 2.0. YARN takes the resource management capabilities that were in MapReduce and packages them so they can be used by new engines. This also streamlines MapReduce to do what it does best, process data. With YARN, you can now run multiple applications in Hadoop, all sharing a common resource management.
